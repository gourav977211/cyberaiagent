AI Agent Title: [e.g., "AI Writing Prompt Generator for Bloggers"]
Deployed Project Link: https://comforting-marshmallow-c63acc.netlify.app/

SECTION 1: BASIC DETAILS
Name: [Your Name]

AI Agent Use Case:
"AI Agent to generate personalized writing prompts for bloggers based on mood, genre, and keywords."

SECTION 2: PROBLEM FRAMING
2.1 What problem does your AI Agent solve?
Many bloggers struggle with writer’s block or repetitive content. This agent suggests unique, tailored prompts to spark creativity.

2.2 Why is this agent useful?
It saves time, provides fresh ideas, and adapts to user preferences (e.g., "Give me a dark fantasy prompt").

2.3 Target User:
Bloggers, content creators, or journaling enthusiasts.

2.4 What not to include?
Avoided multi-turn conversations or saving user history (due to scope).

SECTION 3: 4-LAYER PROMPT DESIGN
3.1 INPUT UNDERSTANDING
Prompt:
"Analyze the user’s input for keywords like genre (e.g., 'sci-fi'), mood (e.g., 'hopeful'), and intent (e.g., 'blog post'). Extract these into a JSON format."

Example Input/Output:

Input: "I need a funny prompt about cats for my blog."

Output: {"genre": "humor", "topic": "cats", "mood": "funny"}

3.2 STATE TRACKER
Prompt:
"Remember the user’s last 2 preferences (e.g., genre) to maintain context. Store as: {last_genre: 'fantasy', last_mood: 'dark'}."

3.3 TASK PLANNER
Prompt:
"1. Identify keywords → 2. Match to a prompt template → 3. Add variability (e.g., 'write from a villain’s POV')."

3.4 OUTPUT GENERATOR
Prompt:
*"Generate a markdown-formatted prompt with a title, 1-2 sentences, and a creative constraint. Example:
Title: 'The Silent City'
Prompt: 'Describe a metropolis where sound is currency. Write from the POV of a thief who steals echoes.'"*

SECTION 4: CHATGPT EXPLORATION LOG
Attempt #	Prompt Variant	What Happened	Change Made	Reason
1	"Give a writing prompt"	Too generic	Added mood/genre filters	Personalization
2	"Remember past inputs"	Failed to retain state	Used system message simulation	Mimic memory
3	"Format as JSON"	ChatGPT ignored structure	Added strict formatting rules	Consistency
SECTION 5: OUTPUT TESTS
Test 1 (Normal):
Input: "A romantic prompt set in Paris"
Output: "Title: 'The Lost Letter'
Prompt: 'A love letter from WWII resurfaces in a Parisian attic. Write the reunion scene.'"

Test 2 (Edge Case):
Input: ""
Output: "Please provide a genre, mood, or topic to generate a prompt."

SECTION 6: REFLECTION
6.1 Hardest Part:
Balancing specificity vs. flexibility in prompts.

6.2 Most Enjoyed:
Seeing ChatGPT adapt to constraints (e.g., "write in Shakespearean style").

6.3 Improvements:
Add user authentication to save favorite prompts.

6.4 Key Learning:
Clear prompts > complex code. Iteration is vital.

6.5 Handling Stuck Moments:
Asked ChatGPT, "How would you improve this prompt for better output?"

SECTION 7: HACK VALUE
Added Markdown formatting for readability.

Simulated "memory" via system messages.
